This GitHub repository serves as a chronicle of my daily learning and growth journey.

It's not merely a facade of daily activity, but an authentic representation of my developmental process in game development and Unity.

Here, you'll find a raw and unfiltered account of the challenges I face, the insights I gain, and the small victories I achieve as I navigate the world of game development.

While this repository captures the essence of my learning journey, it's not curated for presentation. 

For a more polished and systematically organized view of my progress, I invite you to visit my Obsidian blog at https://publish.obsidian.md/huge-chamchi/.

Your interest in my journey is deeply appreciated.

Thank you!
